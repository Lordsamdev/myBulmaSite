# myBulmaSite
This is a prototype of my personal website built using the Bulma CSS framework.
Most developer websites these days look and feel cool, plus they are innovative and are built to show off the developer's skills and creativity.
I have put all my effort in building a personal developer website with an innovative streak that any developer will be proud of.
The site is built using the Bulma CSS framework, a few custom CSS, JavaScript and HTML5.
This site also has the feature to toggle dark mode with the click of a button. This feature is built with CSS and one line of JavaScript!
